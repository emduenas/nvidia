#  An agent for biology teachers
Generative AI Agents Contest NVIDIA

This application aims to provide a Langchain Agent that assists in generating text content suitable for Biology classes targeting 13-year-olds. The agent is built upon the LangChain framework and  NVIDIA AI's NIM APIs for processing power. Additionally, it integrates the CrewAi framework for specific functionalities. To facilitate user interaction, the application employs Gradio for building a user interface.

Running Python on the command line "python agents_nvidia.py" provides a graphical interface at the endpoint http://127.0.0.1:7860/ with Gradio.
